    "# Random balanced network example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, a random balanced network consists of two populations of neurons, one of them being excitatory, one being inhibitory. The two populations are connected to themselves and to one another with weights that result in a stable network activity that neither explodes nor dies out. To get the activity of the populations going, each of them gets an  external stimulation. It is interesting to note here that the inhibitory and excitatory neurons themselves do not differ in their parameters, but only in their connection sign and strengths. \n",
    "\n",
    "More information about the theory of the random balanced network model and links to further literature can be found on [Pierre Yger's homepage](http://www.yger.net/the-balanced-network/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise is to fill in the parts below, which are marked \"TODO\" and create a plot of the network's activity, which roughtly corresponds to the Asynchronous Irregular (AI) state, described on [Pierre's homepage](http://www.yger.net/the-balanced-network/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional information on the commands and models available in NEST can be found on the [NEST documentation index](http://www.nest-simulator.org/documentation/), especially on the [Command index](http://www.nest-simulator.org/helpindex/). Please note that the commands there use SLI's reverse polish notation syntax, which is similar, but not the ame as the one that needs to be used within Python."
